00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,220
So over this module you learned a lot about the basics of redux.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,160
There also are things we haven't had a look at yet, running asynchronous code.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,650
I find it important to first of all dive into the basics though and now start using the basic knowledge

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,200
we gained in our course project in the burger builder.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:29,050
You learned how redux works in general, that you work with reducers and actions, that you connect your react

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:36,970
containers to redux to that store you created, that single store you have, this one, that you can split

7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:42,740
up your reducers into multiple reducers with combined reducers as I showed you

8
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:49,100
and that you should always manipulate your data immutably, never directly mutate a store.

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,710
You also see that we still work with container and presentational components,

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:02,260
we have the containers here which are connected to redux where we get the state as props or the dispatch

11
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:09,640
actions as props and that we then can still distribute our data down to other components.

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:16,600
So this pattern hasn't changed but of course we can create as many containers as we need in the application

13
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:23,130
to connect them to our state and get the relevant slices of the state in each of our containers to then

14
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:30,810
distribute it across all presentational components this container knows. This is redux in its core,

15
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,880
I hope the basics about it and how you use it with react are clear.

16
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,880
Let's in the next lecture use redux in our burger builder application.
