00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,750
So what is state?

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,970
Let me give you some examples.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,690
State for example are the ingredients we added to our burger,

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,730
that's part of our application state, the application state of our burger builder application.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,940
The information, which ingredients we added is crucial because it determines what we need to render to

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,660
the screen,

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,410
how should our burger preview look like there?

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,600
It's also important behind the scenes when we store that burger on a server and we need to submit all

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,780
these ingredients in the HTTP request. Another example would be the question, whether the user is authenticated

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,650
or not,

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,530
that can be super important as it might determine the options we're showing in the menu or the access

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,290
we're granting to certain components.

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:53,190
Also interesting is UI statelike is a given modal open, is a backdrop open, should it be open?

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,640
That's super important too,

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,740
it's less about data like ingredients and user authentication is, it's more about our pure UI only

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,290
state.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,070
It might only be relevant to one single component,

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,810
still this is also an example for a state, more of a local than an application wide state

19
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,890
but still, state determining what should get rendered to the screen and that is in its core what you

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,230
can boil it down to, state influences what you see on the screen.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,250
So therefore our last example would be a list of blog posts which we render, which we might filter, where

22
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,690
we might need to know which of these posts were created by the user,

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,110
also important state we might need in our application.

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,300
And of course the list goes on and on,

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,090
you can add more and more examples here,

26
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,670
now these really just are some examples. What's now so complex about state?

27
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,320
Why do we need extra library for that?

28
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,820
Let's take a closer look.
