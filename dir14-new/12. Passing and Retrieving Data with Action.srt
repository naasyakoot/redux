00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,860
In the previous assignment,

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:11,230
we added three new actions we can dispatch and we do dispatch them in our counter container, decrement,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,420
add and subtract. Now for add and subtract which we obviously handle in our reducer,

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:27,670
it wouldn't make sense to also receive a payload, some additional data passed along with the action type

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,270
because right now, we have hard coded +10 and -8 into the reducer

6
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:40,300
but of course, in a lot of applications for example when creating a new blog post, you would get that

7
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:47,680
information from your component, the input the user entered for example, the ID of the post the user clicked

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,060
on, you can't hard code that into your reducer for that reason.

9
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:59,080
So let's also say we don't want to hard code the value by which you want to add or subtract to the counter

10
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,020
or from the counter into the reducer,

11
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:10,210
instead we want to get this information along with the action, so we can easily implement this. On our

12
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,790
action here,

13
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:18,580
we are just dispatching a javascript object and only the type property is set in stone,

14
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:24,620
so to say. We can obviously add more properties to that object,

15
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:33,690
no one is stopping us from doing that, we can simply add a second property for example value or just V

16
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,600
whatever you want,

17
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,570
you could choose any name you want here and you can of course also add multiple properties.

18
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,700
So I'll take value here, though

19
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:50,020
what you also often see is just payload, payload could then itself be a javascript object which holds

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,290
all the relevant payload to this action.

21
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,550
But that's just something you often see,

22
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:01,130
you can also skip the payload and just have a value and let's say that's ten and a name and that's Max,

23
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,470
so you can add as many properties as you want.

24
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,900
Now here, I'll add one which I'll name val,

25
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,290
again the name is up to you

26
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,940
and let's say we always want to add 10.

27
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:17,730
And of course since we're inside the container, we could easily connect this to some input field

28
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:23,990
we have. Now for subtract, I'll add val and let's say this is 15,

29
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,910
so now I pass the value which I want to add or subtract along with the type

30
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,690
and again, the type property is the only property you have to have where the name is not up to you.

31
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,120
Now we can extract that value property in our reducer,

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,480
so here for add and subtract, I no longer want to add 10 or subtract 8,

33
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:55,600
instead here in the add if check, I'll simply add action.val and here the property name val is of

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,670
course the property name I chose here in my counter container, in

35
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,540
this object I pass in this action, so with the action I dispatch,

36
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:11,330
val, and the same of course for subtracting, here I also simply use action.val.

37
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:17,240
So I as a developer of course know what I named this property when I dispatched the action and I have

38
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,830
to retrieve my value or the data which is relevant to me in the reducer from that same property name.

39
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,320
Save all the files and get back to the application,

40
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,850
now the labels are wrong here we're subtracting 15 actually

41
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,410
but let's click the buttons to see if it works.

42
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:41,840
Let's subtract and we subtract the 15 and we can't add 10 again because we set val to 10 for this button.

43
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,980
So let's quickly update the caption on the other button so that it doesn't say subtract 8, but instead that it simply

44
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,000
says subtract 15

45
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,660
and now our application is 100% up to date. Now though and that's important,

46
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:04,040
passing a payload with the action, passing some additional data and not just passing the type.
