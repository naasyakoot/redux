Welcome to this module, this is a core module in this course,

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,300
it's about redux.

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:16,680
You might already know redux, it's often named together with react but it's a standalone third party library.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:24,480
It is a library often used in react projects though to make state management, the management of application

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,010
state easier

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,540
because that can be hard in more complex react projects.

7
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:37,070
We already saw that in our course project, there we already had some cases like where we have to pass

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,800
data around through query props, where state management became unnecessarily difficult.

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:49,940
Therefore in this module, we'll learn about redux, a solution to this problem which can help us make our

10
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,360
state manageable again.

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,950
For that, let's first understand what exactly state is and what exactly redux then is and how it works.
