1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,390
Let's work on the total price which right now, we still store in the burger builder state but there

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,720
of course, we don't really update it,

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,080
therefore it's always four.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,290
We already set it up in the reducer but we're not changing it here.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,100
Now the price changes whenever we add or remove ingredients, now there are two routes you can take,

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,440
you can define a new action type for the price change,

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:38,180
you could call it update ingredients or update price. And then, we could also of course bind this in

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:45,350
the burger builder at the bottom to a property which we execute to dispatch this action and this action

9
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:53,510
would then simply be called by the reducer and then recalculate the price. This would be fine and it

10
00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:02,150
would ensure that every action leads to just one piece of your state being manipulated in your reducer.

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,350
On the other hand, we already got the only two action types which change our price, add ingredient and

12
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,520
remove ingredient,

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,000
so it would also to be fair to not only update ingredients here but also update the price.

14
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,790
And again it's totally up to you which route you take,

15
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,730
do you only want to change one part of your state per case, then you need to extra action,

16
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,220
are you fine with manipulating multiple pieces of your state? Well then you can take one action, I'll

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,860
go with the latter route here.

18
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,540
So here we already update ingredients,

19
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,870
now we also want to recalculate the price. So I'll also overwrite total price here

20
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:49,330
when returning a new state, again we first of all copied all the old state and all the properties,

21
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,110
now I'm not only overwriting ingredients but also the old price and they are of course, the value

22
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:01,070
now is the state or the total price of the old state, I should say,

23
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:08,350
so the state we're receiving when this reducer is called and now adjust it by the price for the ingredient which

24
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,670
was added.

25
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,080
Now we get this price map for this in the burger builder, here

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,390
we got the ingredient prices, I'll copy that, or I'll cut it

27
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,740
actually, I don't need it here anymore and move it into my reducer.

28
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,780
So there I will now not only define my initial state but also my ingredient prices, we could define this anywhere

29
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,000
in our application, we could fetch this from a database or from a server, though

30
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,850
right now we couldn't because we don't know how to handle asynchronous code but in the future, we will

31
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,680
but I'll simply hardcode it in there.

32
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,550
And there again, we've got the same ingredient property names as we use everywhere in our application

33
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:59,020
so now we can simply set the total price equal to the old total price plus and now access the ingredient prices

34
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,110
for the ingredient we get here in our action, the ingredient name.

35
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:12,100
This will for example access salad here and give us .5 which is then added to the old price and

36
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:22,380
set as the new price here. This is how we can manipulate and update the price for adding ingredients, for removing

37
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:22,860
ingredients,

38
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,610
I'll copy that code and also add it to the remove ingredient case, to the state update,

39
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,670
there of course we deduct the price of the ingredient that we removed.

40
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:40,290
With that if we now save everything, we have to go back to the burger builder because we get some errors

41
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:47,010
down there that we still refer to that old code for updating the price, ingredient prices.

42
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,630
We do this in the ADD_INGREDIENT handler

43
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:57,480
and actually, what we can do now is we can get rid of the add and remove ingredient handler methods here,

44
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,860
cleaning up this file

45
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:06,470
a lot of course. Now with that, if we save that file, save all the files and go back to the application,

46
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,650
we should see that if we now,

47
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,420
let me shrink this little bit to bring it closer together,

48
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,740
if we now update salad and bacon, the price doesn't change,

49
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:28,100
why? Well because we now do update it in our global state through the reducer

50
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:36,360
but of course in the burger builder container at the bottom, we still only fetch the ingredients from our

51
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,740
global state, where we simply have to make sure to also fetch the price here.

52
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:48,000
So from state and there, the property was named total price. With that,

53
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:54,840
we can use price on the props in the burger builder container and we can also remove the total price

54
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,910
from the state there because we're not managing it through the state in the burger builder anymore.

55
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:08,930
So now let's simply use the total price there and everywhere in this part where we use the old total

56
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,960
price on the state, like here,

57
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,500
we should replace it, though for the purchaseContinueHandler,

58
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,510
I won't for now because I'll soon get rid of all this code anyways.

59
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,060
So let's go to the render method and let's make sure to update the price there,

60
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,010
here I want to update it on our build controls where we pass it,

61
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:36,680
we simply now pass this.props.price and in the orderSummary, where we also use the price, this should also

62
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:44,430
be this.props.price, like this, this should be all the places where we use the price.

63
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:51,670
Let's now save this component, go back to the application and start adding ingredients and you see that

64
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,180
we are updating the price now, of course in both directions.

65
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,890
Now one thing we still don't see is that the order now button won't get enabled,

66
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,950
so this is what we'll work on next.
