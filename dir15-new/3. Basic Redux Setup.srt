1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:07,210
Let's add our provider component and therefore let's first of all import it,

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,000
it's named provider from react-redux.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,430
And as I said, we have to wrap the app component with that,

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,330
the question is do we include the browser router or not?

5
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,640
The answer is the provider

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,250
should wrap everything,

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,420
so we'll put it outside of the browser router.

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:36,000
This all gets wrapped by the provider component like this, this is the set up we want to use and there is

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,630
something special about using react-redux with the react router

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,480
and I'll come back to that and how we fix this.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:51,890
It basically has to do with making sure that the connect functionality and the routing functionalities

12
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,300
work together fine because both implicitly set up some props on the wrapping component

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,530
and we have to make sure that everything works there. For now,

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,230
let's create our store though,

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,980
let's import create store from redux in the index.js file and let's also add an import to import

16
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,270
our reducer.

17
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,120
So I'll import reducer from

18
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,440
and now we have to go into the store folder and there import it from the reducer file.

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,250
We can then create our store and store it in a variable or in a constant to be precise named store maybe,

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,990
we create it with the create store method we import from redux and pass the reducer to it, of course.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:42,150
And with that we can then set the store property on the provider component and pass our created store

22
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:50,610
which is stored in the constant store, that are a lot of stores and pass that to that store property.

23
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,840
So now we connect our store which is created by redux with our react application.

24
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,660
Of course this won't do much, in the next lecture,

25
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:08,010
let's work on our reducer and let's make sure that we actually have some logic here to manage our ingredients

26
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,490
through it.
